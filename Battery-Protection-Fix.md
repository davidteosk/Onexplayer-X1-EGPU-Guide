# WHAT IS BATTERY PROTECTION MODE?
## Your X1 was instantly shut down.
Lithium batteries have a built-in battery management system (BMS) offering peach of mind. This system protects your battery from events that could cut its lifetime short. It also manages your battery’s performance and ensures safe operation. Most importantly, the BMS keeps your X1 safe from battery accidents. It will shut the battery down when it detects unsafe conditions. This is called “battery protection mode”.

# What to Do if Your Lithium Battery Goes Into Protection Mode
