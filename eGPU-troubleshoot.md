# HOW TO TURN ON EGPU / ONEXEGPU

matogl0396: totally cold/uplugged everything. connect oculink. connect onexgpu power. turn on onexgpu. wait until windows boots and verify oculink connection via device/task mgr. then connect TB4 for power and dock I/O..... this has been successful for me so far

matogl0396: i think the totally cold boot is crucial for me, not positive but that seems to be the case from what i've read and personally experienced with the device
