Use third-party software like ManyCam.

https://manycam.com/download/

After downloading and using ManyCam, the main differences between it and the handheld camera are as follows:

Enhanced functions:
ManyCam provides many additional functions, such as camera rotation, flipping, filters, background replacement, etc., which are usually not available in the system's built-in camera application.

Multi-camera management:
ManyCam allows you to manage multiple cameras at the same time and switch between them. This is very useful for users who need different angles or devices.

Picture control:
You can adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation and other parameters of the camera picture to get better video effects.

Virtual camera:
ManyCam will create a virtual camera, and other applications (such as Google Meet) can select this virtual camera as the video input source. With ManyCam, you can adjust the picture and add special effects before transmitting it to Google Meet.

How to use ManyCam:

Download and install:
Download and install the software from ManyCam's official website.

Set up ManyCam:
Open ManyCam and select your handheld camera as the video source.  Then make adjustments in ManyCam, such as rotating or flipping the camera screen.
Select ManyCam in Google Meet:
Open the Google Meet meeting, click the three-dot menu in the lower right corner, and select "Settings".
In the "Video" tab, set the camera to ManyCam virtual camera.
In this way, you can use the function of ManyCam to solve the problem of camera flipping and enhance the effect of video calls
